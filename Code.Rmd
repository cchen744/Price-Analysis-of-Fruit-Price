## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
Fruit_Prices %>% group_by(Form) %>% 
  summarize(avgRetailPrice = mean(RetailPrice)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Form, avgRetailPrice),y=avgRetailPrice,fill=Form))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")+labs(x = "Form of Fruit", y = "Average Retail Price", title = "Average Retail Price by Form of Fruit")
```

```{r}
Fruit_Prices_Fresh <- Fruit_Prices %>% group_by(Form) %>% select(Fruit, Form, RetailPrice) %>% filter(Form == "Fresh") %>% mutate(mean = mean(RetailPrice))
Fruit_Prices_Fresh
fresh <- Fruit_Prices_Fresh %>% filter(Fruit %in% c('Apples','Apricots','Cherries','Peaches','Pears','Pineapple'))
```

```{r}
Fruit_Prices_Canned <- Fruit_Prices %>% group_by(Form) %>% select(Fruit, Form, RetailPrice) %>% filter(Form == "Canned") %>% mutate(mean = mean(RetailPrice))
Fruit_Prices_Canned
canned <- Fruit_Prices_Canned %>% filter(!Fruit %in% c('Fruit cocktail, packed in juice','Fruit cocktail, packed in syrup or water'))
```

```{r}
x_bar <- 2.440725	
y_bar <- 2.243925	
PE <- x_bar - y_bar
n_x <- 24
n_y <- 12
s_x <- sd(Fruit_Prices_Fresh$RetailPrice)
s_y <- sd(Fruit_Prices_Canned$RetailPrice)

df <- (((s_x^2 / n_x) + (s_y^2/n_y))^2) / (((s_x^2 / n_x)^2 / (n_x - 1)) + ((s_y^2/n_y)^2 / (n_y - 1))) 
t <- PE/(sqrt(((s_x)^2 / n_x) + ((s_y)^2/n_y)))
t
2 * pt(-abs(t), 33.632)

```{r}

t.test(canned, fresh, 'two.sided')
```

```{r}
